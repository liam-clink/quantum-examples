Some fun examples of quantum mechanics

This is a meson project, so meson is a dependency.

At least for now, I am using the Cuba library for integration.

I have it working with cygwin gcc on Windows, but haven't figured out getting it to work with `cl` yet.
This is probably an issue because Cuba requires cygwin compilation in order to take advantage of multithreading.

No testing on macOS yet.
